#### Credits
Huge thanks to the [ClassiCube project](https://github.com/UnknownShadow200/ClassiCube) for providing a reference. A lot of the code in this clone was based off of it and this project would not have been possible without it.

There exists another similar game (though paid and closed-source), [BLOX](https://www.roblox.com/games/687531143/BLOX), which you should check out.

This project is not affiliated with, sponsored by or supported by Microsoft or Mojang in any way, shape or form.


#### An outline of the features
* Classic terrain gen
* Block placing/breaking with particles
* Block physics (lava, water, sand) (buggy)
* Hotbar and B block selection menu
* Custom playermodels and player physics with classic animation
* WOM-style hacks
* Custom font renderer
* ROBLOX multiplayer support (ClassiCube multiplayer planned)
* Custom ESC menu (hacky)
* Custom chat


#### Importing to ROBLOX Studio
You may use [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) to automatically import everything. It is recommended to set Lighting mode to Compatibility after doing this to make colors more accurate (Voxel and ShadowMap lighting modes distort colors a lot). Make sure to delete Baseplate after doing this, as the Rojo plugin does not do this automatically for you.


#### Play on ROBLOX
You can play a live version of this on ROBLOX [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/3732448315/Vintage-Cube).
